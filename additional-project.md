# Additional Project: NYC stop-and-frisk chart



## Brief

For this additional assignment, your task will be to read the article by the New York Civil Liberties Union - [Annual Stop-and-Frisk Numbers](https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data) - and to make a chart using the data and information that has been written in the document.

Your chart will show several properties in one chart. Your chart must show: 

1. the total stop-and-frisks per year as shown in this chart:
![total stop and frisks per year](https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_area_full_width/public/wysiwyg/image.png?itok=q19ZXA_H)

and 

2. The breakdown for each racial group: black, latino, and white

In this case a stacked bar chart might be appropriate such as the one shown here:

## Instructions

In order to produce this, you will need to do the following:

1. read the article
2. create a `.csv` file that allows you to structure your data (see example below)

```
year,total,black,latino,white,innocent,age_14_24
2003,160851,77704,44581,17623,140442,83499
```

3. create a chart using the data you've prepared using graphing software (e.g. excel), P5.js, or chart making service such as [rawgraphs.io](https://rawgraphs.io/). 
4. Clean up your chart and/or create any legends or annotations necessary to make a compelling and impactful chart.

5. make a write up about your process, analysis, and reflection -- the steps you took to produce the chart such as data preparation and anything your learned while examining the data that you've charted. 

## Submission

You will submit your data you prouced, the chart, and any references that you used to produce the work above. You must cite all your sources and inspiration that allowed you to complete this assignment.
