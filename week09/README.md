Let's chat.

### AMA

Please login here: we're going to document our Q&A: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ay2y3b4o_kLgtA2Lg0Jcc9NAEtjqpvVxbr2zgU8olMU/edit?usp=sharing 

This week our main goals are to address both meta and technical questions about the course content, visualization, and your thesis work. Let's do this AMA style - documenting all the questions and answers. I will assign a scribe, but everyone should try to contribute questions and answers where they can. 

My interest is to start closing some of our more technical exercises and thinking about applications for these efforts towards the work you're doing and also start prompting you to search for datasets



**Project Highlight - Critique & Feedback**

> This book looks into three cities where population growth has reached alarming levels. This was displayed through the use of pattern infographics, using pull out posters and playful risograph colours. I hope to improve attitudes and understanding of the ecology found in urban areas, if only in a small way.
