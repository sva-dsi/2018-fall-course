## Calendar

Here you will find the links to the week-by-week materials and an overview of the course. The due dates for the assignments are posted here (as well as on the assignment prompt) as well as any notes that may be relevant.

NOTE: We might decide together to move some things around this semester. I may also consider to do a few workshops outside the dedicated class time for those who want a little bit more on one topic or another.

## Course Description

Encoding data to visuals is as much an exercise in design as it is a political one. The ways in which we filter, aggregate, scale, and process data into information are an accumulation of decisions guided consciously and unconciously by our training and our biases (and perhaps even ignorances) that ultimately affect people and places from local to global scales. Now more than ever, we carry immense power and responsibility to critically engage with the tools, the people, the institutions, and the discourses surrounding data driven and generative visualizations.

This course is about data visualization and the technologies that allow for information production and propogation. By working through the data visualization pipeline, from data aquisition to designing interactions, we will develop an understanding of how to build beautiful and thoughtful visual outputs using the modern tools and at the same time learn to critically engage with data driven visuals and interactives.

This course is project based, comprised of weekly visualization exercises/projects and culminating in a final project. The goal is to allow you to expand and extend your skills towards your own topic of interest and/or coursework.

## Learning Objectives & Outcomes

The goal of this course is to establish the technical and conceptual foundations for building thoughtful, engaging, and considerate data visualizations. By engaging with each step of the data visualization process, from data acquisition to interface design, you will learn to critically engage with data and the tools and media for communicating through/with data.

Core outcomes of this course include your ability to:

* assess, manipulate, and analyze data
* engage with the culture of data and information visualization and the politics of making data driven visuals.
* create visualizations and other tangible media from data of varying formats and sources using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) (html/css/javascript)
* effectively use version control and collaboration workflows (e.g. Github)
* publish data and visualizations to the web

```

ðŸ—“ If you'd like to meet, please sign up for an appointment via this [Link to Google Calendar Appointments Page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUxEcXhnTHpVYXl1fGRlZmF1bHR8ZDc5ZTU3ZTA3YzM4YWE4OWUxOTZiZWJhNGIzNzhjNDU)


ðŸ“® If none of those times fit, feel free to send me an email with your availability: [Joey's SVA email](@mailto:jlee358@sva.edu)

## Communication

We will use this Github repository as our main organizing platform for resources, links, updates, and more.

If you'd like to share links, ask questions, or field feedback, please feel free to:

* Post to our Class "[Issues](https://github.com/sva-dsi/2018-fall-course/issues)":

<!--

* Chat in our [Gitter Channel]() (it's like slack, but hosted by Github/linked to our class repository):

-->

## Assignments

Each week you will have readings assigned, accompanied by often (but not always) an `Assignment` and a `Practice` activity. See the calendar below to confirm the expectations from week to week. I will grade your assignments and aggregate them as contributions to your final grade. Most assignments are working toward your Final Project, counting as 30% of your final grade.

<!-- [XYZ](https://gist.github.com/) -->
* All assignments will be submitted via [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/) on your [Github](https://github.com/) account OR you may use your personal blogs, however your code files and data need to be easily accessible and usable.
* Joey will repost assignments in Canvas, where possible
* You can view a template of what your assignment should look like here in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/auremoser/9dcfac8163e7737e7b5f).
* Assignments are due on the course date following the class in which they are assigned unless otherwise indicated - there are short assignments every week - Week 2 for example, "Critique an interactive" is due on 9/13

## Grading

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final project. It is understood that coding is tough and you may be new to this, you will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peer reviewers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

GRADE CALCULATION: Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:

* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 50% Assignments
* 10% Project Proposal
* 30% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

Late assignments will be docked 1 letter grade per day until it reaches a "C". If the assignment is not submitted it will be given a "0".

## Readings

Readings are assigned to correspond with that week's assignment and class lesson. I'll be lecturing outside the readings with some references to them, and your assignments will allude to them too. Feel free to read ahead to make certain weeks easier.

As much as possible, I will point you to web resources - I know being a grad student is expensive! However there are a few texts that I would like for you have absorbed by the end of this course and one in particular that I think is excellent:

**Required**:
* The [Truthful Art](https://www.amazon.com/Truthful-Art-Data-Charts-Communication/dp/0321934075), Alberto Cairo

(If for any reason you are unable or uninterested to purchase the book, I'm happy to discuss ways to make a copy available to you / I will make sure to have 1 or 2 available to share. )

**Optional but highly recommended**:
* [Politics of design](https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Design-Global-Manual-Communication/dp/9063694229), Ruben Pater
* [Data Points](http://flowingdata.com/data-points/), Nathan Yau
* [Interactive data visualization for the web 2nd edition](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book), Scott Murray

You can find the [FULL BIBLIOGRAPHY](BIBLIOGRAPHY.md) in the repository for this course.

## Support & Teamwork

In this course, you will be asked to form dedicated support networks consisting of 3-4 people per group. The goal is bring you together to give eachother immediate feedback, inspire one another, and give you a space to grow as colleagues. While you will all be submitting assignments as individuals, it is important that you learn to work together and be willing to help when asked and/or receive help when needed.

This is also a good opportunity to maybe work with some people you don't know well or to build some more projects with people you already do!
