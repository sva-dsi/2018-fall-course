### Final Project Tips: Style Guide

![duo lingo style guide](assets/images/duo-sg.png)

> A styleguide is a set of standards, principles and rules every developer or designer should follow in order to improve the digital presence of the product. - [Andrei Dorin](https://medium.muz.li/how-to-create-a-style-guide-from-scratch-tips-and-tricks-e00f25b423bf)

Developing a [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is an important skill for any project, whether it be a digital product or service or a data visualization or both. Style guides define all of the components of your project - the layout, typography (font sizes, font weights, styles), colors, forms (e.g. rounded edges for boxes, etc). By defining these features and planning a bit ahead of time, this can improve the look, feel, and consistency of the experience people have with your message and the project you're putting forth.

The following references explain what, why, and how you might start to make style guides for your projects.
