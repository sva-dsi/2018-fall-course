" The data file below contains 10 columns.  Columns 1-4 give the dates in several redundant "
" formats. Column 5 below gives monthly Mauna Loa CO2 concentrations in micro-mol CO2 per   "
" mole (ppm), reported on the 2008A SIO manometric mole fraction scale.  This is the        "
" standard version of the data most often sought.  The monthly values have been adjusted    "
" to 24:00 hours on the 15th of each month.  Column 6 gives the same data after a seasonal  "
" adjustment to remove the quasi-regular seasonal cycle.  The adjustment involves           "
" subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor.  Column 7 is a      "
" smoothed version of the data generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic "
" functions with linear gain.  Column 8 is the same smoothed version with the seasonal      "
" cycle removed.  Column 9 is identical to Column 5 except that the missing values from     "
" Column 5 have been filled with values from Column 7.  Column 10 is identical to Column 6  "
" except missing values have been filled with values from Column 8.  Missing values are     "
