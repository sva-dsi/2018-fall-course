**STUDIO:**
- CSS Styling & Navigating the DOM
  - css selections:
    - html and css selectors: `#id`, `.class`. and tag
    - `select()`
    - `selectAll()`
  - css styling
    - we know we can affect lots of properties such as `background`, `font-family`, the layout and much more.
    - we can even do css animations!
    - A cool CSS game for practice:
      - https://flukeout.github.io/
  - keeping track of events
    - e.g. mouseOver and mouseOut on many elements
    - how the keyword `this` is passed during callbacks
  - DOM heirarchy:
    - parent(), child()
    - "all of these dom elements were meant to be blueberries" - @Shiffman // applying a class dynamically: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMRgLi2TBhQ&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bI1SlcCRfLH79HZrFAtBvX&index=13
- External CSS Libraries:
  - CSS frameworks help you to create (often mobile friendly) web pages by using an defined set of classes. They can be really helpful if you want to mock up a site quickly or build a front end web page. As a designer in a data viz collaboration it can be hugely helpful to think through your story telling while prototyping how you envision your story to be told. CSS frameworks aren't necessary for doing this, and sometimes can make things more complicated, but it is worth to know how they work.
  - There are a million of CSS frameworks out there - just web search: CSS framework - but one I've come across that seems alright is the [Spectre CSS Library](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/getting-started.html#introduction). If you want to look at google's css framework, check out [Materialize css](https://materializecss.com/)

## Resources for building the web:
